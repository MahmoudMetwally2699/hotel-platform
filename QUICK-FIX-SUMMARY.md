# Quick Fix Summary: Service Provider Auth 401 Errors

## Problem
- Service provider dashboard showing 401 Unauthorized errors
- React components not loading due to authentication failures

## Root Cause
Frontend components were using raw `axios` instead of the configured `apiClient` which handles authentication headers automatically.

## Solution
Replace all instances of:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
const response = await axios.get('/api/service/categories');
```

With:
```javascript
import apiClient from '../../services/api.service';
const response = await apiClient.get('/api/service/categories');
```

## Fixed Files
- CategorySelectionDashboard.js
- CategoryOrdersManager.js
- ServiceProviderAnalytics.js
- LaundryServiceCreator.js
- TransportationServiceCreator.js
- ToursServiceCreator.js

## Test Credentials
- Email: mahmm@gmail.com
- Password: Password123!
- Role: service

## Result
✅ Service provider dashboard now loads correctly
✅ All API calls properly authenticated
✅ No more 401 errors
✅ Test files cleaned up after debugging
✅ Added activate/deactivate toggle for service categories
✅ Added detailed service item management (LaundryItemManager)
✅ Service providers can now manage individual items with different pricing
